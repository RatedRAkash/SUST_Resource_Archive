## Motivation

Students of CSE, SUST are renowned for their project and resource works. But it is a matter of sorrow that, we don't have any platform to store their works. As a result, many potential works have been lost over time. But if we could store them maybe students from next year could extend these works, develop their ideas, get essential helps etc. 



So, our plan is to develop a website that will store the project and resource works of the students in google drive and display them through our site.
